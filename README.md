# clone_and_add_forks

Clone a GitHub fork as origin, add upstream, and add all other forks as remotes. This essentially mirrors the entire "Network Graph" locally.

## Features

- Clone your fork of a repository as the `origin` remote.
- Add the original repository as the `upstream` remote.
- Automatically add all forks of the original repository as remotes, named as the fork owner's username.

## Usage

```shell
python clone_and_add_forks.py <repo_url> <username>
```

## Example

```shell
Î» python clone_and_add_forks\clone_and_add_forks.py https://github.com/pfmonville/whole_history_rating endolith
