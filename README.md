# clone-and-add-forks

Clones your fork of a repository as the `origin` remote, adds the original repository as the `upstream` remote, and then adds all (or some) forks of the original repository as remotes, named as the fork owner's username.  This essentially mirrors the entire "Network Graph" locally.

## Installation

### Using pipx (recommended)
```shell
pipx install git+https://github.com/endolith/clone-and-add-forks.git
```

### Using pip
```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/endolith/clone-and-add-forks.git
```

## Usage

After installation:
```shell
clone-and-add-forks <repo_url> <username> [num_forks]
```

Or run the script directly:
```shell
python clone_and_add_forks.py <repo_url> <username> [num_forks]
```

Where:

- `<repo_url>`: The full URL of the upstream GitHub repository (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo`)
- `<username>`: Your GitHub username (the owner of the origin fork you want to clone)
- `[num_forks]`: Optional. Number of forks to add (default: ~30, use 'all' for all forks)

```shell
